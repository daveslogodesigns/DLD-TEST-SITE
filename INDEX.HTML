<h1>WELCOME!</h1>
<p>Welcome to Dave's Logo Designs.  Your image is more important than us.  The way we prove it is by always putting your needs inline with our own.
This means that we put ourselves as someone with a vested interest in your company, and work as if the product would represent us.  Contact us today 
for information on how we can set you a part from your competition!</p>
<div id="paragraph-2">
<p>Here at Dave's Logo Designs, we work with you in every aspect, to ensure more then just satisfaction.  If satisfaction was our goal, we'd be 
lying to you.  In fact, complete and utter happiness is our goal.  We don't declare a project done, unless you cannot live without that product.  The 
way we do that is always putting your needs higher then ours, and working with you, through all facets of the process, to make your project the best
one we have ever done!</p>
<p>Please feel free to view our site, and contact us to let us know what we can do.  Our only mission is to prove that your image is more important than
ours.<p>
