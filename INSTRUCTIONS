# DLD-TEST-SITE
Just a test site, as I'm learning code, nothing is official.  Please be patient with me, I'm learning on the fly.  

The desired main effect is to have the banner on the LEFT of the screen, with the paragraphs to the right (enough to see the space 
and be legible and aesthetically pleasing.  

The desired effect with the page is correct with the way that the navbar looks and operates.  May change the name of the tabs to 
make it more level and pleasing.  May tinker with that, though it's not really needed.

PLEASE NOTE:  I am a true noob learning this on the fly and under no pressure to publish a site.  I am learning this for future 
endeavors, to learn coding and site design, to promote more of what a small business that I run can do.  

PLEASE NOTE:  All help is always graciously accepted, appreciated, and desired.  Please take the time to be detailed, not just 
because it helps, it also assists in my understanding, so I can tweak other things without repeating questions.  

Thank you,
Dave's Logo Designs
